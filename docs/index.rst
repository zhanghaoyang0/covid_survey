**a**. STAligner first normalizes the expression proÔ¨Åles for all spots and constructs a spatial neighbor network using the spatial coordinates. STAligner further employs a graph attention auto-encoder neural network to extract spatially aware embedding, and constructs the spot triplets based on current embeddings to guide the alignment process by attracting similar spots and discriminating dissimilar spots across slices. STAligner introduces the triplet loss to update the spot embedding to reduce the distance from the anchor to positive spot, and increase the distance from the anchor to negative spot. The triplet construction and auto-encoder training are optimized iteratively until batch-corrected embeddings are generated. **b**. STAligner can be applied to integrate ST datasets to achieve alignment and simultaneous identification of spatial domains from different biological samples in (a), technological platforms (I), developmental (embryonic) stages (II), disease conditions (III) and consecutive slices of a tissue for 3D slice alignment (IV).

   
Installation
============ 
First clone the repository.

.. code-block:: python

   git clone https://github.com/zhoux85/STAligner.git
   cd STAligner-main

It's recommended to create a separate conda environment for running STAligner:

.. code-block:: python

   #create an environment called env_STAligner
   conda create -n env_STAligner python=3.8

   #activate your environment
   conda activate env_STAligner

Install all the required packages.

.. code-block:: python

   pip install -r requiements.txt

The use of the mclust algorithm requires the rpy2 package and the mclust package. See https://pypi.org/project/rpy2/ and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mclust/index.html for detail.	
	
Install STAligner.
	
.. code-block:: python

   python setup.py build
   python setup.py install
